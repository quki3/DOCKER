# DOCKER

# INTRODUCTION
	
## What is DOCKER ?
		Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.
		SO Docker enables you to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerization.
## What is a container?
		A container is a lightweight, standalone, and executable software package that includes everything needed to run an application,
		including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. Containers provide a consistent and isolated environment for applications to run,
		regardless of the underlying infrastructure.
		So is also a way to package application with all the necessary dependencies and configuration
		Is a very portable artifact, easily shared and moved around this portability make more efficient the deploy and develop
		### where do container live?
				the containers leave in container repository this is a special type of storage for containers many compannies have private repositories they 
				store all their conteiners.
				so but we have public repositories that contain many of the container that you want <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">docker hub</a>

## What is a container repository

	
## Docker vs virtual machine
		Architecture: Docker containers run on a host operating system and share the host's kernel,
		while VMs run on a hypervisor and each have their own operating system.
		This difference makes containers more lightweight and faster to start compared to VMs.
